# water-accessibility
This project will focus on quantifying water accessibility and understanding the relevant factors. It will also involve an analysis of the transportation modal splits for water access across various countries. Data sources will include the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the Malaria Indicator Cluster Surveys (MIS). It will initially be piloted on a few countries in which prior relevant work has been conducted, such as Peru. Data will be integrated and machine learning models will be used to investigate patterns and explain water accessibility and serve as a tool for policymakers and planners.
